    - Composition (has-a)
  - Inheritance
  - Multiplicity
#### 3. Multithreading
  - Especially while using singleton design pattern

## Tips
- Might not ask you to write the entire code but only the classes and functions
- Discuss the requirements and functionalities for each class
  - Usually each class performs **one** task
- For the flow of the system think of how an **actor** will interact with your system
  - Use the flow to Gather requirements, Class diagrams, Relationships
- Deliver the system your **interviewer** is expecting
- Practice problems from LeetCode Discuss
- Mock Interviews
  - Get feedback from peers and mentors about the clarity and efficiency of designs
  - Make a habit to do one Object-Oriented Design (OOD) mock interview daily for an entire week before the interview
